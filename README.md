# AI_Sudoku
AI second Project "Sudoku Solver Agent" has been committed by Sana Jazemi.\
File 'ai' has some kind of conversation with the user so it won't get good mark when it's gotten check by robots.\
File 'ai-TA' in contrast just output a solution to the Sudoku puzzle which The user should write its location on their system in the code before running the code.\
So if you are running 'ai-TA' please first open the code, in the Main section that is the last part of the code, fill the 'loc' variable with the sudoku puzzle(that you want it to be solved) location on your computer system, in the format that is shown, and then run the code.\
At last, Be aware that the code's Algorithm is a Random Algorithm, so if the solution is not right to your puzzle, please run it again.\
